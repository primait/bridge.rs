//! This crate gives an high level api to execute external request.
//!
//! It is supposed to give the basics building blocks for building bridges to the external world
//! while abstracting the low level stuffs like adding custom headers and request tracing.
//!
//! Right now it supports Rest and GraphQL requests.
//!
//! You should start by creating a [Bridge](struct.Bridge.html) instance.
//! This instance should live for all the application lifetime.
//!
//! **Do not create a new bridge on every request!**
//!
//! You should use something like [once_cell](https://crates.io/crates/once_cell) or [lazy_static](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static), or some sort of inversion of control container to
//! pass around.
//!
//! The bridge implement a type state pattern to build the external request.
